<!-- **TL;DR**: We propose a new practical threat model, transfer attacks from public models (TAPM), and build a simple yet effective defense that provides higher robustness than adversarial training with almost no drop in the clean accuracy compared to undefended models. -->

**TL;DR**: We propose the REAP (**RE**alistic **A**dversarial **P**atch) benchmark for evaluating patch attacks and defenses on real images under real-world conditions. Built on top of the [Mapillary Vistas](https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas) dataset, our benchmark contains over 14,000 traffic signs. Each sign is augmented with geometric and lighting transformations for rendering a generated patch realistically onto the sign.
